    <h1>Official Beerball Rulebook</h1>

<h2>Laws of the Game</h2>
<div id="realrule">
<li>
<p>All games shall be played in accordance with the laws of the game as displayed in the following articles. These laws have been built in accordance with the majority views of Beerball professionals and do have the ability to be amended after a formal vote.</p>
<ol>I. Teams and Player Registration</ol>
<p>The game shall be set up with two teams consisting of two players each. The teams and all players must abide by the rules as articulated to the best of their ability and adhere to sportsmanship and respect for the game at all times. In times when such team capacities are not available, a team of differing amounts of individuals will be accepted, provided it is approved by the democracy of the opposing team. A maximum of 6 players is permitted with the above specifications. Teams that withdraw their participation in a Beerball game after it has commenced shall do their best to find a replacement team and will, in turn, forfeit their win. Each team is allowed 2 personal time-outs throughout the duration of the game, and they must clearly inform their time-out and time-in to the ref and opposing team. There are unlimited house time-outs for extraordinary or unprecedented purposes but they must also be called in and out. Players who have official Beerball partners must handle the conditions of their partnership and contract on their own time and outside of official rulings. New players must be informed of the current Beerball laws and be granted access to this book when needed.</p>
<ol>II. Determination of Winners</ol>
<p>Each team will be granted their side of the table after their win and shall be permitted another match if they choose to do so (league play). If a team wins and does not immediately play again, they risk losing their side of the table in future matches. At the end of the match, the winning group shall be the team with the two completely empty cans. These teams must also have poured the empty cans, on their heads during or immediately following their drinking turn. Hats or bandanas are the only things permitted to block spillage from hitting one's head during the 3-4 seconds of required pouring. If a hand or differing object is placed between the spillage of the can and the player's head, a new can is required.</p>
    
<ol>III. Cans</ol>
<p>The permitted beverage for Beerball is carbonated cans, typically a 12oz can of seltzer or beer. If players decide to use a non-carbonated can, the opposing team is qualified to use the same amount of non-carbonated cans as well. The players must place their cans half a thumb length from the corner of the table. If your drink discharges foamage, you are allowed to sip the excess foamage off the top of your can.</p>
<ol>IV. Spilled Cans</ol>
<p>If a can is ever fully horizontal, a brand new can is required, regardless of the amount of liquid discharged from the can at the time of the fall. Additionally, if a can is accidentally knocked over by anything that is not a pong ball, the responsible party and the can owner are required to place the can back up into a vertical position. If a can falls for any reason besides a ping pong ball, it is important that players attempt to return their can to the vertical position as soon as possible. If a can falls and completely empties, the player must still set the can back up in their corner and wait until their turn to pour on their head to be declared finished. In extenuating circumstances, players can fill up a previously open can to the top with a differing alcoholic beverage and forfeit their first sip.</p>
<ol>V. Referees</ol>
<p>The referee is a non-partial, knowledgeable witness to a Beerball game. Bystanders are allowed to provide their input however, if someone announces prior to gameplay that they are the referee, they have the official ruling. If a player or team is called out by the referee for misconduct, or any player or team is cautioned by the referee during the course of a game, it is essential that all players abide. Referees are allowed to institute warnings and punishments for failing to meet the rules stated in this book. Warnings are instituted as a way to correct accidental improper gameplay and are not in place to allow for intentional illegal actions.</p>
<ol>VI. Injury</ol>
<p>In the event of player injury, the teams have the authority to mutually agree on changing aspects of the game, including the following: runners, elbows, duration of drinking, and picking. <br>In the event of an injury, all players must ensure they avoid contact with the injured player to the best of their ability.</p>
<ol>VII. Elbows</ol>
<p>In Beerball, no player can cross their elbow over the edge of the table during a throw. It is vital that players always attempt to withhold their elbows behind the imaginary vertical wall of the edge of the table. All players have two authorized elbow warnings before punishment (one sip for the opponent) is mandated.</p>
<ol>VIII. Charges</ol>
<p>Beerball is considered a contact sport, however, charges are not permitted. A charge occurs when an offensive player makes significant contact with a defensive player who has established their position with both feet solid on the ground. When a charge is committed, one player on the affected team is allowed one sip.</p>
<ol>IX. Moving Picks</ol>
<p>Beerball is considered a contact sport, however, moving picks is not permitted. A moving pick occurs when an offensive player moves their feet, horizontally or laterally, in the process of setting a screen. A player must stay static in their pick for it to be sanctioned. When a moving pick is committed, one player on the affected team is allowed one sip.</p>
<ol>X. Player Uniforms and Equipment</ol>
<p>Players have authorized use of hats and bandanas to be worn and used as spillage protection. Players are also authorized to not wear socks or use socks that aid in floor grip during the game. Additionally, players can use tab openers as long as the other team is also allowed access to the device. One ping-pong ball and a coin for tossing (or rock, paper, scissors) are the only equipment deemed necessary.</p>
<ol>XI. Hits</ol>
<p>It is considered a hit if the ping ball hits an opposing can under any circumstance. Including direct and indirect hits (player's hand, table). It is up to the players, the audience, and the <br>referee's discretion when determining what is considered a hit. If a ball hits both opponent cans on one throw, then both the thrower and drinker are permitted to drink. The thrower is not required to drink and can continue to defend as usual if desired.</p>
<ol>XII. Downs</ol>
<p>The ball is considered down when a player has complete control of it and clearly states down on the table while maintaining possession.</p>
<ol>XIII. Play Challenges</ol>
<p>All challenges will only be entertained if received before the commencement of the next turn during the game in question. All challenges must be discussed with the referees, bystanders, and opposing team. The referee's decisions will be final and no protest regarding the referee’s decisions will be accepted unless a unanimous vote by all players on both teams occurs.</p>
<ol>XIV. Accidental Blocking or Drinking</ol>
<p>Players must keep their entire body behind the neutral axis of the can while on defense.
Accidental blocking of a can during the opposing team's turn, results in a rethrow. Players must spit all the liquid they can back into the can from accidental sipping when it has been decided their opponent’s can was not hit. If this is not feasible, the punishment is up to the audience and the referee's discretion. Accidental drinking after the down was called, results in the opponent being rewarded one sip for each second over the down call, but the punishment is ultimately up to the audience and referee's discretion.
